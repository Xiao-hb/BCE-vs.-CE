# Overview
* We provide the first theoretical proof that BCE can also lead to the NC, i.e., maximizing the compactness and distinctiveness.
* We find that BCE performs better than CE in enhancement of intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness across sample features, and, BCE can explicitly enhance the feature properties, while CE only implicitly enhance them.
* We point out that when training models with BCE, the classifier biases play substantial role in enhancing the feature properties, while in the training with CE, it almost does not work.
* We conduct extensive experiments, and find that, compared to CE, BCE can more quickly lead to NC on the training dataset and achieves better feature compactness and distinctiveness, resulting in higher classification performance on the test dataset.
